Creating spotify playlist using terraform 

The project involves integrating Spotify with Terraform to automate playlist creation and management. First, you'll create a Spotify app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard to obtain the client ID and client secret. These credentials allow you to connect to Spotify's API. Set up a redirect URI at http://localhost:27228/spotify_callback.

Store the client ID and client secret in a .env file to keep them secure. Use the spotify-auth-proxy package, run via Docker, to facilitate authentication and generate an API key. This key is crucial for authorizing API requests.

In your Terraform configuration, set up the Spotify provider using the client ID, client secret, and API key. Store these credentials in a variables.tf file and manage values using .tfvar files to maintain security and organization.

Create a playlist.tf file to define a Spotify playlist resource. Here, you specify playlist details like the name and tracks to be added. Leverage Terraform's capabilities to automate the process, using data sources to dynamically pull data from Spotify, such as user information or album details.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create and manage Spotify playlists using Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach
